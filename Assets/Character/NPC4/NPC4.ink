Well then how should we approach him...
It would be an akward situation if I tried to talk to him while he is with his mother.
The mother might think that I am a bad guy targetting him or something.
Well I can help you to link the your consious self to his mind.
I think that would scare him, like it probably feels like a ghost is talking to you.
(Doesn't seem possible to approach him alone)
//cut scene happens(small trouble like balloon stuck in tree or smth)
Well looks like we have a chance, let's go.
//you helped him

Thank you for helping my son
Yeah no problem!
The child tries to hide his face behind his mother while grabbing the shirt on both side.
Sorry, my child is a little shy when there are strangers around.
No worries, I don't really mind. Does he frequently stick to you?
Umm well, he usually would stay beside me all the time. 

//probably because of separation in a crowd before


//get chance to talk with the boy and the mother

->END
